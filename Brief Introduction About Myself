My name is Maryanne, a university student specializing in mathematics with a strong passion for data analysis and community empowerment. I thrive on solving real-world problems using practical business and technical skills, and I enjoy leading projects that blend clarity, impact, and empathy. Whether it's managing academic tasks, creating visual learning aids, or facilitating inclusive meetings, I always aim to make learning accessible and meaningful.
I’m deeply committed to supporting girls and students in underserved areas, especially through creative, low-cost solutions. From designing interactive Scratch stories to troubleshooting websites and formatting assignment-ready answers, I bring a resourceful and results-driven mindset to everything I do. My goal is to keep growing as a leader and data analyst while building sustainable change in my community.
