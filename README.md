# MyFirstRepo
A beginner-friendly repository created to explore GitHub basics, version control, and collaborative coding. This project includes sample files, practice commits, and foundational documentation to help new developers understand how repositories work. Ideal for learning how to track changes, push updates, and manage code in a structured way.
This is my first repository created as part of a GitHub learning task.
